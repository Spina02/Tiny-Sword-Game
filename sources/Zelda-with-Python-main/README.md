# Zelda-with-Python ‚öî
A Zelda-like game I made with Python following this tutorial https://youtu.be/QU1pPzEGrqw. This is one of the best and longest Python projects I ever made, it's a really great way to learn OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in Python!

# How to Download and Run ‚¨á
1. Make sure you have Python installed and Pygame too. If you have Python, go to the Command Line and type `pip install pygame`.
2. Download this Repository (You can clone it) or head to the [`releases page`](https://github.com/SpyderGamer/Zelda-with-Python/releases).
3. Extract the ZIP file and find the `Main.py` file which is located in the `Code` folder.
4. Run this file and enjoy! <br /> 

Also, there is a folder with pictures included to help you with the download process.

# Goal üéØ
The goal of the game is to kill many monsters and get EXP to upgrade your skills! If your health runs out, the game will close automatically, so **DON'T DIE!** Goodluck! Also, this code is not a full game, its just a nice project to pass time. It shows how powerful Python really is!

| `Arrow Keys` | Move |

You can upgrade your skills using the EXP you get from killing monsters. Each skill has a cost. Navigate the menu with the Left and Right buttons, and press Space to upgrade a skill! After you're done, press M again to exit and continue playing.
